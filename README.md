# Proxy-Server-CSharp
In this tutorial, we provide an example of how to "create a simple proxy server in a C#" application using the HttpListener class. We also show how to write a test case to verify that the proxy server works as expected.

To run a proxy server in a C# application, you will need to use the HttpListener class, which provides a simple way to create and listen for HTTP requests in your application. 

To create a test case for a proxy server in C#, you will need to write code that simulates a client making a request to the proxy server, and then checks that the proxy server correctly forwards the request to the destination server and returns the expected response to the client.

This test case creates a new HttpListener to listen for requests on the specified URL, and then creates a new HttpWebRequest to send a request to the proxy server. The test case adds an X-Destination-Url header to the request to specify the destination URL that the proxy server should forward the request to.

Once the proxy server sends a response, the test case uses the Assert class to check that the response has the expected StatusCode and ResponseUri. If the response is not what we expected, the Assert methods will throw an exception and the test case will fail.

You can modify this test case to test different scenarios, such as different request and response types, error handling, and so on. You can also use a test framework such as NUnit or xUnit to organize and run your test cases automatically.
