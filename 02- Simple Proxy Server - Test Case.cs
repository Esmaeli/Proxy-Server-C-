/*
A test case for that:

To create a test case for a proxy server in C#, you will need to write code that simulates a client making a request to the proxy server, and then checks that the proxy server correctly forwards the request to the destination server and returns the expected response to the client.

Here is an example of how you might write a test case for a simple proxy server that forwards all requests to the destination URL specified in the X-Destination-Url request header:

*/
// Define the destination URL that the proxy server should forward requests to
string destinationUrl = "http://www.example.com";

// Create a new HttpListener to listen for requests on the specified URL
HttpListener listener = new HttpListener();
listener.Prefixes.Add("http://localhost:8080/");
listener.Start();

// Create a new request to the proxy server
HttpWebRequest request = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create("http://localhost:8080/");

// Add the X-Destination-Url header to specify the destination URL
request.Headers["X-Destination-Url"] = destinationUrl;

// Send the request and get the response from the proxy server
HttpWebResponse response = (HttpWebResponse)request.GetResponse();

// Check that the response is what we expected
Assert.AreEqual(HttpStatusCode.OK, response.StatusCode);
Assert.AreEqual(destinationUrl, response.ResponseUri.AbsoluteUri);

// Close the response and the listener
response.Close();
listener.Close();

/*
This test case creates a new HttpListener to listen for requests on the specified URL, and then creates a new HttpWebRequest to send a request to the proxy server. The test case adds an X-Destination-Url header to the request to specify the destination URL that the proxy server should forward the request to.

Once the proxy server sends a response, the test case uses the Assert class to check that the response has the expected StatusCode and ResponseUri. If the response is not what we expected, the Assert methods will throw an exception and the test case will fail.

You can modify this test case to test different scenarios, such as different request and response types, error handling, and so on. You can also use a test framework such as NUnit or xUnit to organize and run your test cases automatically.
