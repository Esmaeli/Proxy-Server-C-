/*
To run a proxy server in a C# application, you will need to use the HttpListener class, which provides a simple way to create and listen for HTTP requests in your application. Here is an example of how you might use this class to create a simple proxy server:
*/
// Create a new HttpListener to listen for requests on the specified URL
HttpListener listener = new HttpListener();
listener.Prefixes.Add("http://localhost:8080/");
listener.Start();

// Wait for a request to be made to the server
HttpListenerContext context = listener.GetContext();

// Get the request and response objects
HttpListenerRequest request = context.Request;
HttpListenerResponse response = context.Response;

// Modify the request as needed (e.g. to add headers, change the URL, etc.)
// ...

// Forward the request to the destination server
HttpWebRequest destinationRequest = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(request.Url);

// Copy the request headers from the original request to the new request
foreach (string header in request.Headers)
{
    destinationRequest.Headers[header] = request.Headers[header];
}

// Get the response from the destination server
HttpWebResponse destinationResponse = (HttpWebResponse)destinationRequest.GetResponse();

// Copy the response headers from the destination response to the client response
foreach (string header in destinationResponse.Headers)
{
    response.Headers[header] = destinationResponse.Headers[header];
}

// Get the response stream from the destination response and copy it to the client response
using (Stream destinationStream = destinationResponse.GetResponseStream())
using (Stream outputStream = response.OutputStream)
{
    destinationStream.CopyTo(outputStream);
}

// Close the response and the listener
response.Close();
listener.Close();
/*
This code creates a HttpListener object and listens for requests on the specified URL (in this case, http://localhost:8080/). When a request is received, the code creates a new HttpWebRequest object and forwards the request to the destination server. It then copies the response from the destination server back to the client.

This is just a basic example to show how you might use the HttpListener class to create a proxy server in a C# application. There are many other details that you will need to consider when implementing a real-world proxy server, such as handling different types of requests and responses, handling errors and timeouts, and so on.
